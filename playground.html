            All of the butttons below are generated from a JS function. The HTML files are located in a folder in the same directory as the HTML file you are reading. Here i have made it so that whenever i create a new HTML file in the folder, a button will be generated for it. The button will have the same name as the HTML file i don't have to go back to this HTML page and link it manually. The JS file will automatically do it for me. How have i done it? By using GitHub's API. I use the API to find all the HTML files in the folder and then i use the API to get the content of the HTML files. I then use the names to link them to the acctual file in the JS function. I want all my projects to be automatically be loaded in, as if it was Youtube.
